# 🎓 JobSphere

## 📝 Project Overview

**JobSphere** is a full-featured job application and recruitment platform built with **Java Spring Boot** on the backend and **React** on the frontend.

Recruiters can post, update, or delete job listings, manage applications by shortlisting or rejecting candidates, and view uploaded resumes and SOPs. Job seekers can browse and filter job listings, apply with a Statement of Purpose (SOP), upload their resumes and profile pictures, and track the status of their applications. **JobSphere** offers a secure, intuitive, and end-to-end solution for modern hiring needs.
